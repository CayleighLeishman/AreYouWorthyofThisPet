# AreYouWorthyofThisPet
A quiz that asks five questions to determine if you are worthy of one of the three pets

# Overview

In this assingmnet I was trying to learn how to use Intellij on top of using Kotlin code. While I used Intellij to write the program I ended up using Visual Studio Code to push and pull to/from the Github repository. With the Kotlin language, I went ahead and made a "Are you worthy of the Pet?" Quiz. 

I wanted to experiment with Kotlin and try to use a different IDE. I also wanted to make it so that if you were "worthy" of the pet, a picture would pop up of the pet in question. If you weren't, it was supposed to repeat the quiz until you were worthy or until you said you were done with the quiz. 

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code.  Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment

I used Intellij to type the code in and Visual Stuido Code to upload to github. 

I ended up just using straight up Kotlin.

# Future Work
Things I'd like to work on:
* Preparing enough for when emergencies arive and I can't work on it
* Practicing or playing around with the IDE before I start coding
* Getting images to work for the Kotlin
